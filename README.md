# ROCK PAPPER SCISSOR
Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game played between two participants, in this case, a user and a computer. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: rock, paper, or scissors. The outcome is determined by the rules:

- Rock crushes scissors (rock wins)
- Scissors cuts paper (scissors wins)
- Paper covers rock (paper wins)

The computer randomly selects one of these three options, and the user does the same. After both have made their choices, the winner is determined based on the interactions between the selected shapes. If both participants choose the same shape, the game results in a tie.

The game is known for its simplicity and quick play, making it a popular choice for a quick decision-making activity or a fun way to pass the time. The element of chance adds an exciting factor, as neither player knows for sure what the other will choose.
